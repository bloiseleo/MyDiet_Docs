# ü•¶ MyDiet Documentation

### The Problem
When I was younger and trying to lose weight and become healthier, I used MyFitnessPal to track my calories. However, when I tried it again recently, the experience was disappointing. Some vital, previously free features had become premium, and the main capabilities of the app were now inaccessible to me.

### Objective
To practice my programming skills and help myself lose weight, I decided to create a reduced version of MyFitnessPal. This document serves as the foundational guideline from which I will draw inspiration while modeling the application.

## ‚ùáÔ∏è Key Features
- The user should be able to create meals and calculate their calories. The process must be intuitive and straightforward.
- The app should primarily focus on the current day. It should not overwhelm the user with information about meals from previous days. This is essential because maintaining a diet is challenging, and each day is an achievement. If you failed yesterday, you can try again today as if it's the first day.
- The user should be able to create a menu. A menu is simply a list of meals he has previously made. If the user wants to repeat a meal, he can easily do so in the food diary.
